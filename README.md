UAV Control Panel

This project provides a control panel for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The control panel can be used to monitor, update, and manage the flight parameters of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle).

UAV Class:

The UAV class represents the properties and behaviors of an unmanned aerial vehicle. Each instance of a UAV is associated with a specific flight path, parking area, speed, engine power, fuel level, and altitude.

Installation:

To clone the project or download the ZIP file:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repo_url>
Usage:

To compile and run the UAVControlPanel.java file:

bash
Copy code
javac UAVControlPanel.java
java UAVControlPanel
These commands will by default execute the main class of the project and print the initial status of a UAV, followed by its updated status to the console.

Example Usage:

java
Copy code
public class UAVControlPanel {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of a UAV
        UAV uav = new UAV("Route 1", "Parking Area A", 25.5, 80.0, 150.0, 500.0);

        // Display the initial UAV status
        System.out.println("Initial UAV Status:");
        uav.displayStatus();

        // Update the UAV flight parameters
        System.out.println("\nUpdating UAV Flight Parameters...");
        uav.updateFlightParameters(30.0, 85.0, 120.0, 600.0);

        // Display the updated UAV status
        System.out.println("\nUpdated UAV Status:");
        uav.displayStatus();
    }
}
Output:

plaintext
Copy code
Initial UAV Status:
Flight Path: Route 1
Parking Area: Parking Area A
Speed: 25.5 m/s
Engine Power: 80.0%
Fuel Level: 150.0 liters
Altitude: 500.0 ft

Updating UAV Flight Parameters...

Updated UAV Status:
Flight Path: Route 1
Parking Area: Parking Area A
Speed: 30.0 m/s
Engine Power: 85.0%
Fuel Level: 120.0 liters
Altitude: 600.0 ft
